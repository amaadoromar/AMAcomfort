# AMAcomfort

This is a basic static website developed in 2020 to apply what I learned academically in HTML and CSS. The website consists of several web pages that provide information about furnitures. The main purpose of this project was to apply the fundamental concepts of web development, such as HTML tags, CSS selectors, and responsive design ( Media Queries ).
